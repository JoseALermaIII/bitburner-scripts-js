From the [vscodium.com](https://vscodium.com/) page:

> VSCodium is a community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of Microsoftâ€™s editor VS Code.

Not only that, but it also disables telemetry. This custom build also means that it lacks the online account and syncing feature, but it's a small price to pay for privacy.

It's also missing Microsoft's VS Code Marketplace (and their proprietary tools/extensions), but there are [ways around it](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/blob/master/DOCS.md#howto-vscode-marketplace), albeit [legally questionable](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/31168).

Otherwise, it's exactly the same as VS Code, with an independent extension gallery and [process for migrating from VS Code](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/blob/master/DOCS.md#migrating).

**Tip:**
> I recommend getting the [vscode-eslint extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/dbaeumer/vscode-eslint) to help with linting.


### Windows Setup
Similar to my [Python environment](https://josealermaiii.github.io/python-tutorials/getting_started/installation.html), I like to use [PortableApps.com Platform](https://portableapps.com/download), to create a portable base environment.

This necessitates going with [portable mode](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/blob/master/DOCS.md#how-do-i-run-vscodium-in-portable-mode) in a subfolder like, `X:\PortableApps\VSCodium_x64`.

For Windows and Linux, it's the same as [VS Code's portable mode guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable). There's a note in VSCodium's guide for a file path difference for those wondering about macOS.

From there, we can keep up with the portable theme by installing embeddable versions of the software we need.

#### Node.js

Luckily, Node.js already offers a zip file on their [downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

To integrate it with our portable platform, it's easy to extract it into a folder, like `X:\PortableApps\CommonFiles\node-v16.14.2-win-x64\`. If you want different versions of Node.js, you can make different folders e.g. `node-v8.17.0-win-x64`, `node-v16.14.2-win-x86`, `node-v17.7.2-win-x64`.

A great thing about VSCodium is that the `bitburner-scrips-js` repo already has the [settings.json file](https://github.com/JoseALermaIII/bitburner-scripts-js/blob/master/.vscode/settings.json) from the `.vscode` folder that shows how to get it to find the portable Node.js installation:

```
    "debug.javascript.defaultRuntimeExecutable": {
        "pwa-node": "X:\\PortableApps\\CommonFiles\\node-v16.14.2-win-x64\\node.exe"
    },
```

Now that we have a JavaScript runtime, some versioning would be nice.

#### Git
Believe it or not, Git does offer a *Portable ("thumbdrive edition")* on their [downloads page](https://git-scm.com/download/win), which can be installed somewhere like, `X:\PortableApps\CommonFiles\PortableGit\`.

Getting it to work with VSCodium requires a bit more effort. The [settings.json file](https://github.com/JoseALermaIII/bitburner-scripts-js/blob/master/.vscode/settings.json) already includes these lines to help when running a terminal from within VSCodium:

```
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Command Prompt",
    "terminal.integrated.env.windows":{
        "PATH":"${env:PATH};X:\\PortableApps\\CommonFiles\\node-v16.14.2-win-x64\\;X:\\PortableApps\\CommonFiles\\PortableGit\\bin\\",
    },
```

Similar to Atom.io, VSCodium has built-in git versioning extensions, so including the above also helps it find the git executable.

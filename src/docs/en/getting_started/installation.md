There are many ways to install and use Node.js depending on the platform and IDE (Integrated Development Environment) â€” if any. These docs cover the methods I frequently use.

### Windows
For Windows, I ended up going with {@tutorial vscodium_setup} because it's more updated.

I'm sure [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) would be even more extensible and full-featured than VSCodium, but I'm equally confident it'll be far more resource-heavy.

After Node.js and your IDE of choice are installed, run `npm install --production` in the `bitburner-scripts-js` folder.

### Building Documentation
**Note:**
> Building the documentation is **not needed or recommended** unless contributing to the documentation.
> 
> The latest version of the documentation is available at [josealermaiii@github.io/bitburner-scripts-js](https://github.com/JoseALermaIII/bitburner-scripts-js).
> 
> You have been warned.

Building the docs requires a few more npm packages that are installed with `npm install`:

* @babel/eslint-parser
* jsdoc

Now, we can build the docs in HTML format:

```
    npx jsdoc -c ./conf.js
```

This will save the docs website in `../../bitburner-scripts-js-docs/`.

**Tip:**
> If you followed {@tutorial vscodium_setup}, this can be run as the `npm: doc` task under **Terminal > Run Task...**.

## bitburner-scripts-js

Example implementations of scripts used in the programming-based incremental game [bitburner](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner#readme). 
Other helpful scripts can be found in [bitburner's docs](https://bitburner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guidesandtips.html) or in the 
[official GitHub repo for scripts](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-scripts#readme).

It's a fantastic idle game with cyberpunk themes that explore the possibilities of future technology. It's a great way to get tricked into learning about JavaScript since most of the UI actions can be scripted. Not only that, but it can run on anything that runs JavaScript!

Bonus content includes JSDoc docstrings (such wow) and main functions (so standard).
